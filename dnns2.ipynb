In this assignment you will explore some of the model architectures we talked about in the second half of lectures (ConvNets, Transformers) and you will also implement a fun model called MLP Mixer.\n\nThere are 70 marks given in total for this second assessment ($70\\%$ of the total of 100 marks for the course), broken into three sections:\n* (D) 10 marks for the ConvNet exercise\n* (E) 20 marks for the Transformer/MLP Mixer exercise\n* (F) 40 marks for a mini-project of your choice\n\n#### Compute Resources: Kaggle Notebooks\n\nSince this Assignment benefits from GPU acceleration, we recommend using the [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks) platform. Kaggle notebooks are similar to google colab, but offer a more predictable 30 hours/week quota on their GPUs for free. This is plenty of GPU time to get the assignment done, you shouldn't need any more.\n\nHowever, use your GPU quota sparingly, for example switch to a non-GPU instance unless you are working on tasks that need a GPU, and terminate your session once you're not working on it. To enable GPUs and Internet access, you need to verify your phone number on your kaggle account. This can be selected in the Notebook options section of the panel to the right of the actual notebook. Please talk to us if any issues arise.\n\n#### Mini-projects\n\nMini-project tasks are a more exploratory and open-ended, giving you an opportunity to decide which aspect you'd like to focus on. The idea is to introduce you to the form of assess\\ment typical in our Part III/MPhil modules. Mini-projects come with instructions, to indicate the depth of work we expect for certain marks, but you should feel free to deviate from instructions if you have a better idea to explore within the context. There are two options, one with a more theory/maths focus, one with more of an engineering focus.\n\nAs a guide, when marking we will take into account three factors:\n\n* **extent of work:** did you do the expected amount of work (you won't get extra marks by doing a lot more than others, this is not a race). We will try to give an indication of this in the module description.\n* **correctness/technical understanding:** is your solution and description of findings technincally correct, does it demonstrate learning and understanding of the topics we cover, and an ability to do independent reading if needed?\n* **presentation:** How is the mini-project written up? Please focus on the writeup being short, to the point, well structured. Are figures well formatted, so it's clear what's shown on them (e.g. are there axis labels)?\n\nYou can choose whichever project you want to attempt. You can attempt more than one, but we will only mark one. **Please clearly state which of the mini-projects you would like us to mark**, if this is unclear, we will mark whichever appears fist in your submitted notebook.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# D: Feature Visualisation in ResNets\n\n_[10 marks] 1 page writeup + appendices_\n\nAlthough vision transformers have taken over in the large data setting, convolutional networks remain popular due to their parameter-efficiency and superior performance on smaller data.\n\nIn this question, we ask you to explore the features that a [ResNet 18](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html) model (considered tiny by today's standards) learns when trained on the popular ImageNet dataset.

While the first layer's convolution kernels are interpretable, deeper featuremaps are less so, since these featuremaps integrate information through several different computational paths and from a larger area of an image. In this work you will generate visual \"explanations\" of various featuremaps in the form of input images for which the targeted feature values are highly active. Follow the method described in [the article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdistill.pub%2F2017%2Ffeature-visualization%2F%23optimization).\n\nStarting from a grey image (e.g. `0.5*torch.ones(...)`), use gradient-based optimization of the input image to find images such that on these resulting images, certain internal activations in the network take maximal (or at least very high) values. At first, use no additional regularisation (that's the next part). Create optimal images that maximise:\n* a single activation in the middle (horizontally and vertically) of a chosen feature map/channel.\n* a row of activations along a horizontal line in the feature map, in a single channel\n* the sum of all activations of a single feature map (channel) across the whole image.\n* the sum of all activations across all channels and spatial locations in `layer3`\n\n*Tips:*\n* When optimizing the activation in the middle of the image, expect to see a localised pattern that's most intense in the middle.\n* Don't forget to apply the correct normalisation to the image before feeding it to the network. The correct normalization to use is included [in the documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html).\n* Make sure the network is in evaluation mode, and that its parameters are not changed by your optimisation procedure.\n* You may want to use the [`torch.no_grad()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.no_grad.html) environment when applying operations which you don't want to end up becoming part of the computational graph.\n* This will be much faster if you switch to a GPU backend.

Regularised Feature Visaulisation\n\nThe previous method has likely produced rather grainy results, often with periodic artifcacts, as explained in 'The Enemy of Feature Visualization' section of [the article](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/#optimization). To obtain more natural looking, and thus more interpretable results, it helps if we add some regularization. A simple regularisation technique is to apply Gaussian blur, small rotations or magnification\nto your image between gradient steps. This is demonstrated in the post. Repeat the first task but now with this added regularisation approach.\n\n*Note:* The feature visualization reference contains very interpretable, and beautiful results. Getting these pretty images is often a result of extensive tweaking of the methods on the basis of subjective criteria, and the authors of this writeup really knew what they were doing.

Instead, we will pretend we don't know that the group is isomorphic to integers, and we will encode the 97 elements of the group as arbitrarily chosen tokens. This way, the model will have to build a useful representation of group elements.\n\nMathematically, we consider the following dataset:\n\n* token alphabet $\\Sigma$ of size $97$\n* a bijective map $\\pi: \\Sigma \\mapsto \\mathbb{Z}_{97}$, where $\\mathbb{Z}_{97} = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 96\\}$\n* a dataset consisting of pairs of inputs $x = [x_1, x_2] \\in \\Sigma^2$ and labels $y \\in \\Sigma$ such that:\n\n$$\n\\pi(x_1) + \\pi(x_2) \\equiv \\pi (y)\\ \\ (\\operatorname{mod} 97)\n$$\n\nFor simplicity, we can choose the alphabet $\\Sigma$ to be $\\mathbb{Z}_{97}$ in which case $\\pi$ becomes a permutation.\n\nNote that there are $97\\times 97 = 9409$ unique possible datapoints, forming the Cayley table (multiplication table) for the 97-element cyclic group.\n\nYour models will have to learn to predict $y$ from $x$, given only a fraction of all pairs as training data.

There are 25 entries, corresponding to 25 possible datapoints. We will sample 18 of these as training data, while 7 (shown in grey) are held out as test data.

Decide whether you want a decoder-only, encoder-only or encoder-decoder transformer for this task.\n1. Decide whether you need position embeddings.\n1. Remember that autoregressive transformer language models use causal attention masks. Does your model need this, if so, where?\n1. Since the label you predict is discrete, you have to choose the loss function that reflects this.\n\n\nThen implement a model. You may use pre-existing layers or building blocks, for example [TransformerEncoderLayer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer.html). Please don't simply import or copy a complete model used someplace else. Nor do you have to implement attention from ground up. Finally, your implemented Transformer model on a set percentage of the modular addition data.\n\n\nHints:\n* A decoder-only transfomer is composed of token and position embeddings as the first operation, these are followed by causal transformer layer.\n* By causal masking I referred to the Masked Self-Attention layer (with a triangular mask so each token only aggregates information from the past but not the future). Pytorch provides masking functionality via an argument to the `forward` method.\n* The original Transformer used layer normalization after the other operations, later it's been observed that it's better to normalize before the operations.

Although it might look complicated, it is easier to code from scratch than a Transformer as it uses standard layers.\n\nThe MLP mixer was inspired by encoder-only transformers, which have alternating blocks of multi-head self-attention and fully conected networks (MLPs). The attention layer communicates information across tokens, while the fully connected network processes each token in isolation, in parallel.\n\n###¬†MLPs are All you Need\n\nBelow is a drawing of the MLP-mixer architecture. (the figure labels tokens as \"patches\" and embedding dimensions as \"channels\", owing to the fact that this architecture was introduced in a vision context)\n\n![](https://mchromiak.github.io/articles/2021/May/05/MLP-Mixer/img/Mixer.png)\n\nThe MLP mixer model replaces multi-head attention with an MLP. As a starting point, like in a transformer, an embedding layer maps our input to a tensor of size `batchsize * sequence_length * embedding_dim`.\n\nThen, it alternates two kinds of blocks:\n* odd blocks apply an MLP across tokens, with input and output dimension `sequence_length` evaluated in parallel for every input in the batch and every embedding dimension.\n* even blocks apply a MLP across embedding dimensions, with input and output dimension `embedding_dim`, evaluated in parallel for every datapoint in a batch and every input token.\n\nPlease implement your MLP Mixer architecture from scratch (i.e. using basic pytorch layers such as `Linear`, `ReLU`, `LayerNorm`, but please don't use a pre-defined MLP Mixer).\n\nNotes:\n* as you see, in the original architecture includes `LayerNorm` which speeds up training, as well as skip connections like in a ResNet which are especially important in deep versions.\n* the pytorch [`Linear` layer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) is implemented in such a way that it always applies matrix multiplication to the last dimension of a tensor, and the operation is carried out in parallel for all other dimensions. This will come very handy here.\n* The MLP mixer only works on a fixed size input sequence. Thus, it is nice for image processing, and it applies to our situation where the input is always two tokens long.\n* Like Neil Suggested, to make these architectures work in the low data regime, regularisation is likely helpful. Weight decay combined with AdamW could be a good starting point.","metadata":{"id":"huHgf5Da1M0w"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class MixerBlock(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_tokens, embed_dim, token_mlp_dim, channel_mlp_dim, dropout_rate):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.token_mlp = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.LayerNorm(num_tokens),\n            nn.Linear(num_tokens, token_mlp_dim),\n            nn.GELU(),\n            nn.Dropout(dropout_rate),\n            nn.Linear(token_mlp_dim, num_tokens)\n        )\n\n        self.channel_mlp = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim),\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, channel_mlp_dim),\n            nn.GELU(),\n            nn.Dropout(dropout_rate),\n            nn.Linear(channel_mlp_dim, embed_dim)\n        )\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        y = self.token_mlp(x.transpose(1, 2)).transpose(1, 2)\n        return x+y + self.channel_mlp(x+y)\n\n\nclass MLPMixer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_tokens, embed_dim, num_classes, num_layers, token_mlp_dim, channel_mlp_dim, dropout_rate=0.1):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.token_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_classes, embed_dim)\n        self.mixer_blocks = nn.ModuleList(\n            [MixerBlock(num_tokens, embed_dim, token_mlp_dim, channel_mlp_dim, dropout_rate) for _ in range(num_layers)])\n        self.layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(embed_dim, num_classes)\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.token_embedding(x)\n        for block in self.mixer_blocks:\n            x = block(x)\n        x = self.layer_norm(x).mean(dim=1)\n        return self.linear(x)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-25T03:27:01.297130Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-25T03:27:01.297449Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-25T03:27:01.304391Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-25T03:27:01.297427Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-25T03:27:01.303736Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset = Mod97Dataset(list(range(97))).cuda()\n\n#model = MLPMixer(num_tokens=2, embed_dim=64, num_classes=97, num_layers=1, token_mlp_dim=64, channel_mlp_dim=64).cuda()\n#train_model(model, dataset, train_split=0.9, num_epochs=1000, learning_rate=0.002, num_batches=10, weight_decay=0.6)\n\n#model = MLPMixer(num_tokens=2, embed_dim=97, num_classes=97, num_layers=2, token_mlp_dim=64, channel_mlp_dim=64, dropout_rate=0.1).cuda()\n#train_model(model, dataset, train_split=0.7, num_epochs=1000, learning_rate=0.001, num_batches=10, weight_decay=1.2)\n\nmodel = MLPMixer(num_tokens=2, embed_dim=97, num_classes=97, num_layers=3, token_mlp_dim=64, channel_mlp_dim=64, dropout_rate=0.2).cuda()\ntrain_model(model, dataset, train_split=0.6, num_epochs=1000, learning_rate=0.0009, num_batches=20, weight_decay=0.8, betas=(0.95, 0.999))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-25T04:12:49.777127Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-25T04:12:49.777417Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-25T04:14:42.135574Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-25T04:12:49.777394Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-25T04:14:42.134877Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"With 60% of data for training; learning_rate=0.0009\n\tEpoch     0:   Training Loss: 4.7103,  Test Loss: 4.6981\n\tEpoch   200:   Training Loss: 0.5757,  Test Loss: 7.8838\n\tEpoch   400:   Training Loss: 0.0701,  Test Loss: 2.5839\n\tEpoch   600:   Training Loss: 0.7426,  Test Loss: 1.8026\n\tEpoch   800:   Training Loss: 0.3175,  Test Loss: 1.0129\n\tEpoch  1000:   Training Loss: 0.0102,  Test Loss: 0.2780\n\tAccuracy of \"best-guess\"es on the test set:\" 96.27% \n\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## E.4: Evaluate data-efficiency of the models\n\nOnce you have a working version of one or both of the models above, evaluate generalisation performance for varying fractions of training data used (using as low as, say, 10%, all the way to using almost all).\n\n**Important:** Please use `random_split` utility to split the available data, into training and test, or perhaps training, validation and test.
